# Web Application Security Assessment  

## Overview  
Welcome to my Web Application Security Assessment project! This project focuses on identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in web applications. I am currently working on this project and will upload all related materials and findings soon.  

## Objectives  
The primary goals of this project are:  
1. To analyze the security of web applications against modern threats.  
2. To implement secure practices to mitigate vulnerabilities.  
3. To demonstrate practical skills in web application security assessment and remediation.  

## Planned Activities  
Below are the key tasks I will perform during this project:  

### 1. OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities  
- Identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities such as:  
  - **SQL Injection**  
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
  - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**  
  - **Insecure Deserialization**  
  - **Security Misconfigurations**  

### 2. Threat Modeling  
- Developing a threat model to understand and visualize potential threats to the web application.  

### 3. Secure Authentication  
- Implementing robust authentication mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication (MFA).  

### 4. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)  
- Using tools like **Burp Suite** and **OWASP ZAP** to automate and enhance vulnerability scanning.  

### 5. Patch Management  
- Researching and applying security patches to resolve identified vulnerabilities.  

## Tools and Technologies  
The following tools and technologies will be used in this project:  
- **Burp Suite**  
- **OWASP ZAP**  
- **Threat Dragon**  
- **Postman** (for API security testing)  
- **Kali Linux** (for security tools)  

## Status  
I am currently working on this project, and the deliverables (e.g., documentation, tools, and scripts) will be uploaded soon. Stay tuned!
